      <p>You want to know me? Well I'm a 14 year old girl who goes to school at the Bronx High School of the Visual Arts. I have many interests and hobbies like art, editing, and listening to music as such. People seem to enjoy my art and edits so I would like to pursue that as a career, digitally or not. </p>
